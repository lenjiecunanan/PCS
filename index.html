But despite all the exposure to IT, she was never really interested in it, as she only sees it as another subject to pass and another extracurricular activity to boost up her grades. Her interest in IT sparked when she met her stepfather, who is a Security Data Architect. She further realised how massive the influence of IT is in all areas of jobs. Hence, why she pursued to learn more about it.

<p> <h5> <center> Group Chemistry </h5> </center> </p>
<p>
PCS’s group personalities are majorly composed of Extroverts, Intuitive, Feeling, and Judger. <br>
Catherine has a personality of an Extrovert, Sensor, Thinker, and a Judger. She is natural when it comes to organizing, level-headed, articulate, and direct. While, Shashika and Jack almost have the same personality – Intuitive, Feeling, Judger, the only difference is Jack is an Introvert while Shashika is an Extrovert. Unlike Catherine, Jack and Shashika both lean on trusting their feelings rather than their mind but also follow their intuition rather than what their senses tell them.
</p>

<p>
The learning style of the group is the majority of Tactile and Visuals. Bank is however unique as he is both equally Tactile and Visual and is also slightly Auditory learner. The team mostly learns through touching and doing, they prefer "hands-on" learning where they can touch, move, build, or draw what they learned, and tends to learn better when some type of physical activity is involved.
This means, as a team PCS must make learning fun and exciting. While working on projects, meetings and daily communication is important as they all learn from each other through visually explaining ideas. They will also require breaks often as they are active and tend to lose focus when stuck in one position at times.
</p>

<p> 
According to the test, the working style of the group is greatly compatible. Catherine is a person who likes everything planned out, relationship-oriented, and realistic. She also does not admire people who waste her time. Shashika on the other hand, is also a strong-willed person, likes a good plan and communicates her ideas well and knows how to keep people engaged. They both inquire and collect information before they act. Jack is also a man of having core life goals which he works hard for. Jack likes to use his talents in a way that allows him to achieve success and feel positively about his contribution to the world. He is also great at developing unique ideas, the creative mind in the mostly detail-oriented group.
</p>
 
 
 <p> <h5> <center> Ideal Jobs </h5> </center> </p>
 <p>
 <ul>
 <li> Catherine: <b>Human Resources Consultant </b> </li>
<li> Shashika: <b>Cyber Security </b> </li>
<li> Jack: <b>Database Administrator </b> </li>
<li> Bank: <b>Cloud Engineer </b> </li>
</ul>
</p>

<p> 
The common aspect in the group’s ideal job is that they all touch on with IT. All the jobs involve analysing data, though for different purposes. Catherine analyzes human resourcing and workplace data while the other three involve internet and cyber data. Across the group, the minimum qualification for the job is the same except for the HR Consultant which requires some business and management knowledge.

  <p> <h5> <center> Reflection on Git's Repository Audit trail </h5> </center> </p>
<p>
  Git repository has been a helpful instrument in completing this project. Through Git, we could identify who modified the codes, who added their work and which part they have changed. It was also easier to use as the platform is simple to understand, even for someone that does not really have deep knowledge in IT. Although, we encountered some issue. While using Git, as a group I think we have all neglected the part where we have to clone the repository on our own devices in order to run the changes smoothly or not delete someone else’s changes when committing to change in repository at the same time. We eventually solve it and now value and will remember that lesson all the time.

  <h3 class="w3-center">IT TECHNOLOGIES</h3>
  
<p> <h5> <center>Internet of Things(IoT) </p> </h5> </center>
<p>
The Internet of Things is a system where the computer and digital devices interconnects through sensors and transmit data without human contact. This is an internetworking system where our daily life connects to exchange data through internet. This technology controls electrical equipment remotely and helps most of the industries in the world such as manufacturing, transportation etc.	</p>
<p>
Most people use IoT through their wearables such as fit bits and smartwatches where this technology is used as a wearable technology. IoT helps to communicate through devices where describes as machine to machine communication. IoT applications are another way to use this technology for the smart appliances at home where people can use to control their electrical equipment. Also, health care uses IoT applications to examine and analyse data for medical researches. Smart Cities are another concept which came through IoT. It helps people for their daily activities such as traffic controlling to ease the problems without happening accidents. IoT gave agriculture field a new concept named Smart Greenhouse where farmers can yield crops with less costs. Industrial Automation is another field where IoT applications come to work with logistics, inventory, factory digitalization, quality control and packaging.  
</p>
<p>
In three years, IoT will help Automobile industry as they invested over $100 billion on self-driving cars development in last five years. Autonomous vehicles will be developed through IoT to transmit data through mechanical sensors and GPS with the technology to give the ultimate comfort to the driver. Cellular technologies such as NB IoT and Cat-M1 will be expanded through 5G network expansion according the reports from the Ericsson as the network expands the benefits will be on the reduction hardware prices and cellular technologies. As businesses are identifying the opportunities through IoT, the companies are investing more on this technology to gain profits in future. Industries such as clothing, healthcare, agriculture and municipalities are investing on IoT to have IT solutions through IoT networks. So, in future there will be more developed solutions for those industries other than in IT industry to help customers through their daily life. According to a research by McKinsey Global Institute, there will be a rapid growth in IoT as most companies are using this technology in modern ways such as tracking the supply chains using sensors. Home IoT market will grow making daily life easier with smart electrical appliances, entertainment devices, security systems etc. Moreover, manufacturing companies will start to use more IoT devices for their process to get best result from efficient energy and high level production with IoT machines which are capable of automated tasks.
</p>
<p>
IoT is consisted of hardware devices, software, communication and platforms. Hardware is the smart devices which IoT technology uses to gather data and communicate through. Software is the main component which works as the major part in the hardware devices which helps to gather data and transmit through IoT technology. Smart devices are connected through the communication to transmit collected data through connectivity solutions such as cellular, LAN, satellite or IoT environments such as ZigBee, Thread, Z-Wave, MQTT, LwM2M. These solutions do not work as only an option to send and receive data through cloud, where it works as a third party to communicate with other devices as well. IoT platforms are where that data collected, processed, analysed and transmitted through a user-friendly interface. Short range solutions like Bluetooth, RFID supports IoT technology to transmit data through devices such as wearables and helps to locate object positions in industries such as logistics through radio frequency identification. RFID has been developing to locate patients in healthcare industry to minimise the issue of out of stock situation in stores. Implementing these technologies can reduce costs and will help to get best from IoT technology for users.
</p>
  <p> <h6> <center> Impacts of IoT </p> </h6> </center>
<p>
IoT technology impacts whole world from daily life of a person to industries such as logistics. Calculating the heart rate through a smart watch and transmitting the data and notifying the users about changes of any health conditions will help users to be alert and it’s not simple as that when IoT technology locates a user through their own wearables for their own safety in an difficult situation. Things will change from high power to low power where expensive solutions will be replaced by cheaper solutions for the users with giving more benefits to the users such as Sigfox connectivity solution. Sigfox helps various kinds of M2M applications to implement smart street lighting system, smart security systems, smart monitors and sensors. Automobile, Healthcare, Manufacturing, Agriculture, Retail, Hospitality, Finance and Transportation will be most affected industries through implemented IoT technology. From Self cars in Automobile industry to smart sensors in manufacturing processes IoT helps through every step to succeed in industries. People in these industries can use this technology to ease the tasks and unfortunately some jobs will be replaced through this technology in most industries. However, more jobs will be come to place because of the maintenance of these devices and technologies whenever they need. Jobs related to IT sector will be expanded as more technologies get implemented.
</p>
<p> <h6> <center>Impacts of IoT as Users </p> </h6> </center>
<p>
As a user, my costs will be low with IoT technology because it minimises the energy costs where we spend so much, and it makes our lives easy through smart homes and smart cities as well. Traffic will be eased, and more time will be saved on the roads and more tasks will be done by the IoT technology where we used to do everything manually. If something is wrong at my home when I am outside, I’ll get notifications to know without ending up to big mess through our daily lives. These implemented devices guarantee us more safety when we care more about our family and friends such as tracking their locations when they are alone or talking to each other even via smart watches. Developing waste management solutions through IoT will be more helpful when it comes to effect soon as it is a great way to improve the environment which affects all of us.  Personal health will be the most important thing where we can check irregular patterns in our heart rates, sleeping patterns of us and our loved ones too.
</p>
<h5><center>Cyber Security</h5></center>
<p>
 Cyber Security is the protection we get to protect our hardware, software, network and data from malicious attacks and theft. Cyber Security provides the protection to individuals and enterprises from cyber-attacks to which uses sensitive data in different ways. It changes day by day with the developments of the technologies and it challenges in four types of threats. Malware, Ransomware, Social engineering and Phishing can be the main threats where cyber attackers use to attack systems. Malware is a malicious software which can harm systems through worms, viruses etc. Ransomware is an attack where attacker locks the systems through encryption and demand money to unlock the system through decryption. Social engineering makes people believe on false human interaction and breaks security procedures to collect data. Phishing is a way of sending fraudulent emails acting as reputed sources and collect sensitive data. Application, security, Information security, Network security, Disaster recovery planning, operational security and end user education are the most important element which are used in cyber security to keep the challenges up to date for security risks. Everyone gets the benefits from cyber security as it gives protection from your photos in your storages to sensitive data in organizations.

After the Covid-19 pandemic, most of the people started to work from home where the security came to talk of the town. From using web conference applications for the meetings to transmitting data from their own laptops to the systems of the organizations cyber security helps in every form to protect data without giving any clue for the attackers.
</p>
<p>
According to the Australian Cyber Security Growth Network, investments on cyber security is expected to grow 7.2% each year to 2026. The global cyber security industry will be expanded bay by day in future years as the benefits from this protection will be gradually started to increase with more cyber users. As new technologies emerge there will be advanced threats in future to deal with and to face that new researches would be found, and more cyber security experts may be needed in future. Unfortunately, there is a shortage in jobs of cyber security industry and where it will become more in coming years. 
</p>
<p>
Networks is the biggest challenge in the cyber security as faster internet will provide attackers immediate access to vulnerable systems such as 5G network. In future Smart Cities will rely on the networks and the cyber-attacks will be a threat for them to access the services for crimes. So, advanced cyber protections may be needed to avoid those cybercrimes in future. Artificial Intelligence is a vital component to help cyber defence where it can promote the global immunity for the cyber-attacks. However criminal community is seizing the development of AI and challenges the global with cyber threats. There will be a growth of cyber-crimes in financial sector in coming years using AI such as mimicking humans and biometric data for bank accounts to taka the control of them. Developed biometrics are used against these threats to authenticate the control over systems and it requires more details to access someone’s data to control specified accounts. Cyber security experts suggest three factor authentications to make processes secure and strong.
</p>
<p> <h6> <center> Impacts of Cyber Security </p> </h6> </center>
Business will be affected digitally with cyber security because it gives a protection for the data and systems of the organizations. Personal information will be secured as it protects from the attacks. Attackers are selling personal information to third parties and security solutions prevent it by working as protective layer. Security solutions will impact the productivity of employees as their systems will not be impacted by malicious attacks and in the same time employees will be safe with their data as they are relying on a protection. 
</p>
<p>
  Spywares are like an infection which affects to your computer system and spy on your work on your system and get the data to cyber-criminal community. Security solutions such as Fortinet’s FortiGate Firewall prevents these spywares to affect the systems and in future there will be advanced security solutions to protect the users. Adware is computer virus where it fills your system with advertisements and let other viruses to enter your system. Security solutions prevent adware to ease the users even when they accidentally click those advertisements. Security solutions prevents cyber-crimes by acting as a consolidated solution where affects virus, spam, firewall, wireless networks and online content. 
</p>
<p> <h6> <center> Impacts of Cyber Security as Users </p> </h6> </center>
<p>
  Protection is the most important benefit we can have as users in the fast-growing IT sector. From personal social media accounts to bank accounts we are having the benefits of the cyber security protection from the attackers. Gaining knowledge through reputed sources are more important as users to prevent from tricks of the attackers. Improved protection in the services and products we use through online is a great fact to have confidence as customers. Data protection is another important fact we must deal with as attackers are using those data against the users for personal reasons as well. When the security improves, we have the trust and confidence to use the services and products as customers such as financial services. Preventing unauthorized users with technologies such as Biometrics with AI is a relief for the users because it prevents accessing personal accounts. Also, personally as a student in IT industry I prefer cyber security for my career path because there is a expanding growth in future. More jobs will be available in cyber security where there will be shortage in future. Studying cyber security will be a great advantage for students in IT field will a good opportunity to have a great career in cyber security.

<h5><center>Cloud Computing</h5></center>
<p>
  Cloud computing is a software-based infrastructure where delivers services and tools such as storing data, servers, software and networking. Cloud storage helps to store data on a server where users can access from anywhere with a device and internet connection. Software-as-a-Service (SaaS), Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS) and Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS) are the three cloud computing services which are primarily used. SaaS is a license system for software such as Microsoft Office where users use in pay and go method. IaaS is an on-demand service where users can have access from storage to operating systems through IP connection such as Microsoft Azure and IBM Cloud. PaaS has similarities with SaaS but differentiate with instead of providing the software online PaaS provides the opportunity to create software applications. It is the most complex platform and most recent examples for it is Force.com and Heroku.
</p>
<p>
  We can use cloud-based software applications from anywhere with an internet connected device. It makes more easier by providing mobile applications and connecting through browsers where users can share anything at any time. Also cloud based platforms have eased users with their service of backing up data such as photos, documents, videos with platforms such as Dropbox, Google drive.  In the past, organizations had to maintain their own storage systems and in present it has been easy with cloud-based platforms. Earlier users had to buy software CD physically but in present the upgrades and sales are through online where users have access for trials as well.
</p>
<p>
  Covid-19 pandemic helped us to realize the benefits of cloud-based platforms as most employees had to work from home. It is impossible without cloud computing technology to work from home where it impacts to the economic where we cannot have access physically for most things.
</p>
<p>
  According to Logic Monitor’s ‘Cloud Vision 2020: The Future of the Cloud’ study, 83% of enterprise workloads will be in the cloud in years’ time. The digital world is almost in the cloud-based platforms and other organizations are entering to it gradually. In three years, most of the companies will primarily operate in cloud-based environments which is flexible, productive and cost efficient. 
</p>
<p>
  UX design will be most prioritized in cloud-based platforms in future as users prioritize services which are user friendly. IBM Cloud took the initiation for that by winning the 2019 Indigo Design Awards for its usability and interface. Desktop-as-a-Service (DaaS) will be widespread as it eases the tasks of users. DaaS is a virtual desktop where users can use by logging on and off from any computer with internet connection. App to App technology will integrate more apps in a single platform by helping to run multiple applications in a single platform. Trial to paid conversion rate is 30% where it will increase more in future. 
</p>
<p> <h6> <center> Impacts of Cloud Computing </p> </h6> </center>
<p>
  Most beneficial impact of cloud computing development is the cost reduction of the organizations. Upfront costs and maintenance costs will be reduced as billing model will work for the cloud platforms as per the usage. Also, it gives services as the demand increases where users do not have to worry about purchasing more services initially and users can increase their services whenever they want. 
</p>
  <p>
    Cloud platforms are flexible in different ways as users can switch to any cloud service whenever they want. User friendly interfaces will be more efficient as beginner users can understand easily and it will ease the tasks of the users as well. In future more career paths will be open where most organizations will transform into digital. Working from home and Studying from Home methods will be used more as it reduces problems such as traffic, environmental pollution. 
</p>
<p>
  Global warming will be a bad impact of this technology as using more servers for the storage solutions has making heat and it impacts on the environment making the situation worst. Cyber Security plays a vital part on Cloud Computing technology as it gives the protection to the data and whole platforms. While migrating data from clouds, protection is the most important as it will leak because of a cyber-attack. Users must learn the cloud system as it will make sensitive data exposed with one mistake. So, employees and managers will have a learning curve while using cloud platforms as beginners.
</p>
<p> <h6> <center> Impacts of Cloud Computing as Users </p> </h6> </center>
<p>
  As Users, cloud platforms help in many forms such as storing data whenever user wants and backing up data without any problem where we can access them whenever we want. Negative impact is leaking data from those platforms with any mistake from the users and they will expose to anyone is such thing happens. Virtual desktop is one of the easiest components for users who are employees and students where they can save or finish their own projects whenever they can. App to App technology will make easy for us as students if they are used in our university platforms as well. Cloud platforms have given us the opportunity to buy most of the products online instantly and in future it will be used more as most organizations are transforming to digital. It will reduce costs and delivery charges such as delivery charges for software application CD.
</p>
<p>
  User friendly interfaces will be introduced, and it will be easy to use cloud platforms with difficulty. Companies will have their minimalist designs as per the user needs and it will make us more comfortable to use these platforms in future. It will make the tasks easier as we do not have to search simple things on the interfaces to do our tasks. 
</p>
<h5><center>Natural Language Processing and Chatterbots</h5></center>
<p>
  Natural Language Processing shortened as NLP is the technology where used to make understand the human natural language. It is a component of AI which interacts with humans and computer systems. NLP is used in translate applications such as Google translator, word processors such as Microsoft Word and Grammarly, interactive voice response (IVR) applications and digital personal assistants such as Siri, Alexa. Processing human languages is not an easy task for computer scientists as computers can not master languages like humans do. NPL applies algorithms to transform human languages and converts into a form which computers can understand. 
</p>
<p>
  Main techniques used in Natural Language Processing is Syntactic and Semantic analysis. Syntax is making a sentence in a proper grammatical way where it is understandable. It uses grammatical rules to make the meaning of the sentence. Lemmatization, morphological segmentation, word segmentation, part of speech tagging, parsing, sentence breaking, and stemming are the syntax techniques that are used in the process. Semantic technique uses the meaning of the text where this process is still implementing stage. Named entity recognition (NER), word sense disambiguation and natural language generation are the techniques which are used in the Semantic technique.
</p>
<p>
  Chatterbot is an Artificial Intelligence software which used for a conversation with the users in natural language through software applications, websites and telephones. This is the most advanced invention where software application interacts with humans, but it is a software application with questions and answers which uses Natural Language Processing. Identifying user requests and extracting data is the main process of the chatterbot. Chatterbots are mainly used for businesses where they need an interaction between humans and services to enhance the customer experience. AI technologies are most used in chatterbots such as Natural Language Processing, semantic techniques and machine learning.
</p>
<p>
  According to MarketsandMarkets research projects, Natural Language Processing market will be increased by 15% in future. Artificial Intelligence, powerful processors and cloud computing makes NLP more revolutionary day by day. Chatterbots are progressing with understanding human languages and responding them in an accurate manner. NLP will be used for Smart homes in future as it will take the user requests and process them accordingly such as switching off the lights with a voice command from the user. Future of the NLP is Natural Language Generation (NLG) where it will process numerical data and present them to humans in an appropriate way. Implementing Artificial Intelligence tools and Natural Language Generation will help large organizations to process data effectively in a timely manner. NLG will be used in finance, banking, media, retail, government and healthcare to detect fraudulent activities, manage data and to enhance the customer experience. In three years, it has been predicted that NLG will be a main component of Business Intelligence (BI) eco system.
</p>
<p>
  According to Global Insights, Chatterbots global market will be over $1.3 billion by 2024. For most organizations, chatterbots are a cost reducing method where they will do the simple tasks such changing passwords for the customers without human involvement. Voice recognition technology is improving to give advanced services such as Google Allo where comes with Google Assistant which supports voice and texts both. Social media will use Chatterbots for their business profiles as it is becoming the easiest way to interact with customers with their ongoing businesses. Future Chatterbots will automate customer payments and orders while making a huge step in chatterbot industry. 
</p>
<p> <h6> <center> Impacts of Natural Language Processing and Chatterbots </p> </h6> </center>
<p>
  In future industries such as media will no longer struggle for their content as NLG will provide solutions for them. Most of the media organizations has started using NLG to cover up event stories and it will increase in the future. NLP will be combined with IoT applications to help humans to access smart compliances in Smart Homes concept. It would expand to Smart Cities in future as well. Organizations will reduce the costs after employing NLG in their organizations instead of humans. It will impact on job market and the creativity of the content will be at a risk for organizations such as media industry. People who works as writers will be impacted and the quality of the content at the same time. 
</p>
<p>
  Chatterbots is another cost reducing and marketing tool which can use for organizations in cost reducing method instead of humans in future. People who work in customer service and marketing field will be affected as Chatterbots will work instead of humans. As an automated system there is a risk of spamming messages through social media platforms as users will receive automated messages. Improved chatterbots which are user friendly will be used by users as the new trend is user friendliness in the digital world.
</p>
<p> <h6> <center> Impacts of Natural Language Processing and Chatterbots as Users </p> </h6> </center>
<p>
  NLP will be a great solution for users who are eagerly waiting for Smart Homes concept and it will ease the daily life tasks of families. As creativity writing workforce will be challenged and as the audience, we will be affected with low quality content without creativity as machines can not adapt to creativity like humans. As NLG will come to effect, retail and healthcare industries will be easier to reach as users. Customer experience in those industries will be enhanced and detecting fraudulent activities in finance and banking sector will make us as users more secure and confident to use their services more often.
</p>
<p>
  Chatterbots make lives easy for users with acting as customer service agent in after hours and holidays where we can chat and find the solution instantly. In future these chatterbots will be used more and implemented according to the behaviour of organizations. Automated payments through chatterbots is still making users feeling risky as we do not have the safe feeling to use our credit cards details through automation without guarantee. Secure automation systems will make users happy in their own process where they can adopt protective layers from cyber security.

  <h3 class="w3-center">PROJECT IDEAS</h3>
 <center> <img src="fashion.jpg" alt="fashion" width="450" height="300"> </center>
  <p>
    Fashion and dressing up is never easy for everyone. Some have good eyes on fashion and immediately know what to wear while others just grab the first thing they can get from their wardrobe, and the other bunch spends so much time thinking on what to wear. According to The Telegraph, a recent study found that the average woman, in the course of her lifetime, spends almost one year standing in front of her closet deciding what to wear. The study, which polled 2,491 women and was based on an adult lifetime from age 16 to 60, found that women spend an average of 16 minutes deciding what to wear on weekday mornings and 14 minutes on Saturdays and Sundays, for a whopping 287 days spread out over their lives.
</p>

<p>
<ul>
<li> Hitting the town on Friday night – 20 minutes </li>
<li> Christmas party or fancy dinner event – 36 minutes </li>
<li> Heading out of town for a vacation – 52 minutes </li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>
And on regular weekday mornings, most women try on at least two outfits before deciding what to wear to work.
</p>
<p>
This is why our group introduces *Noting to Wear*. <br>
Noting to Wear as you guessed it is adapted from the common phrase we say when we have “nothing to wear”, which really just means having an exact outfit in my mind but does not own the exact pieces to put that outfit together. Noting to Wear is a fashion styling app that composes and suggests the users what to wear depending on the weather, their area of location while also considering their own collection of clothes.
</p>

<center> <img src="avatar_qr.PNG" alt="avatarqr" width="550" height="300"> </center>

<p>
  NtW allows the user to create their own avatar, add their clothes collection through the QR code that is attached on the clothes when first bought or scan the clothes itself to allow the app to collect the form and color of the users’ dress or shirt. The application also encourages the user to allow the app to collect their location, in order for the app to figure the weather of that area and its fashion trends. The user is allowed to choose and input the occasion or the purpose of their dressing up.
  </p>

<p>
For example, the user has a date with her partner on Thursday night. She inputs the location of where she and her partner will have their date, it then allows the app to collect the weather of the area. Since she is a new user, she scanned her clothes to build her clothes collection in the app, she also scanned the QR codes of the dresses she just bought. So now, the app has all the information it requires to suggest the user what to wear.
</p>
<ul>
<li> Occasion: <i> Date night </i> </li>
<li> Location: <i> Melbourne CBD </i> </li>
<li> Weather: <i> 32C Warm </i> </li>
<li> When: <i> Thursday 25th </i> </li>
</ul>
The app will then suggest something like this.
<center> <img src="Inkeddressup_LI.jpg" alt="dressup" width="450" height="300"> </center>
</p>
<p>
  The user’s avatar is now wearing an outfit appropriate to the suggested inputs.

<p> <b> Reflection: </b> </p>
  <p> <ul>
  When I enrolled in this class, I was already expecting it to be really challenging as I never had recent IT knowledge and I am not really as excited as everyone else in the class to learn it. I did this class just to finish off my degree, but to my surprise with the help of my group mates, I have enjoyed it more than I expected. I believe our group has very good chemistry, we help each other, we communicate well, even though not often but when we get together, it is always productive. We all learn from one another. Even though we are facing circumstances - COVID19,everyone in the group has still been really responsible and always looking out on their communication channels which helped so much in the success of this project. Everyone in this group has potential and I hope they all work well to achieve their goals for the future.

Shashika’s work has been great all throughout the project. She has helped me a lot, especially in narrowing my ideas as sometimes I tend to just blab on and on. She always has positive attitudes on whatever task is assigned to her.
</ul>

 <ul> <p> <i> Jack: </i> </p>
 
Jack is great. Although he is quiet, he still delivers up to standard work output. He introduces great ideas and is always present when needed. For the future, I could suggest he speaks up more and overcome his shyness because he is smart and is a very good addition to our group.
</ul>

 <ul> <p> <i> Bank: </i> </p>
 
Bank joined our group late. To be honest, I never expected much from him but he has proven himself that he is more than I thought of him. He is very responsive, does not shy away exchanging and challenging ideas. I am proud of what he has contributed to this group.

    Introduction to IT is one of my favourite subjects from this semester as it is exciting to study with interesting lectures and practicals. It refreshes us with the knowledge we have and helps us to experience different kind of assessments when compared to other subjects. Assessments gives us the opportunity to work as individual and as a team as well where we experience the teamwork. PCS team consists with people who has different personalities and abilities where we can achieve our goal together even through Covid-19 situation. I am fortunate to take part in this wonderful team from my very first day where I found team spirit.

 <p> <b> Reflection: </b> </p>
   <p>
    <ul>PCS group is a harmonious and friendly group which contains 4 group members from different area. By doing the assignment2 with division of labor cooperation, we show the strong cooperation ability and communication skills among teammates. Finally, we got the work done with good quality before due day of the assignment. So, thanks for everyone’s effort to our group. The thing surprised me a lot is when someone in our team met with difficulties about the assignment, the whole team would immediately solve them, each group members would give the ideas to the group and we discuss and compare the ideas together. The team sprit touched me a lot. Also, one thing I want to mention about me is that, sometimes I felt nervous because I want to express my idea, but I cannot find an appropriate word to describe it immediately, and I need to check the dictionary to find it out. However, thanks to my teammate’s patience about my poor English, I think I should improve it in the future. The things I have learnt about group is when we work as a group, keep in touch and exchange our ideas when we are working are very necessary.</ul>

 <ul> <p> <i> Shashika: </i> </p>
   She is a very hardworking teammate.  she was brave to undertake the most difficult task of the teamwork and did it very well. All the teammates like to work with her.

 </ul>
 
 <ul> <p> <i> Bank: </i> </p>
   He is the kind of teammate that always completes his part of work first, and then he would help the other teammate to figure out their problems. It is comfortable to work with such a reliable person. </ul>
  
   <p> <h5> <center> Bank </h5> </center> </p>
<p> <b> Reflection: </b> </p>

    <ul>First of all, Me as a member who joined the PCS team late after the team was established. Therefore, I think I can perform better in this team and this assignment. For example, I may be able to discuss more with my teammates and exchange our ideas. However, thanks for other three team members in the PCS, the assignment went well at the first stage when we all agreed on the topic. One thing I am surprised about is  the team works together and solve problems together no matter how small the question is. In addition, to keep contacting and discussing with teammates is what I learned from this team. It is significant to exchange ideas and help each other when troubles come. Lastly, Since we do our section individually and my section is Industry Data, I think the Github log of activity can reflect when and who is doing their job, which is important as a group.
    </ul>
    
<p> <b> Feedback: </b> </p>

  <ul> <p> <i> Catherine: </i> </p>
  Lenjie is one of the most active members in our team, she likes a leader who constantly interacts, exchanges ideas with us and also done the most jobs in this assignment.

 <ul> <p> <i> Shashika: </i> </p>
 She is also a great member to work with. Patikiri is not shy to share her ideas towards us and done her part of the assignment well too.
 </ul>
 
 <ul> <p> <i> Jack: </i> </p>
 Jack is likely to be a silent teammate, and also does his job well silently. It is great to work with a team member like him.
