    <p> <b> Lenjie Cunanan s3660421 </b> </p>
    <p>
Lenjie, more known by her second name “Catherine” is born and bred in Philippines. She moved to Australia in 2015 to be reunited with her parents. Her hobbies include, cooking, hiking, and playing board games. When she was in Year 7-10, she learned the basics of HTML, she has also been a contender for some IT quiz bowls in her school. But despite all the exposure to IT, she was never really interested in it, as she only sees it as another subject to pass and another extracurricular activity to boost up her grades. Her interest in IT sparked when she met her stepfather, who is a Security Data Architect. She further realised how massive the influence of IT is in all areas of jobs. Hence, why she pursued to learn more about it.  
  </p>
    
    <p> <b> Patikiri Arachchige Dona Wijayasekara s3856842 </b> <p>
    <p>
Patikiri or more known as “Shashika”, originated from Sri Lanka, bearing her, her Sri Lankan and Sinhalese culture, also fluent in English, Sinhala, Tamil, and Hindi. Shashika has been in Australia for 7 years now. She has a hobby of following up with fashion styling which she wishes to build a blog, someday. Her interest in IT started at an early age of 10, when she had her first lesson of IT. She further seeks more learning into it in her Year 10 where she took up Diploma in IT. However, in Year 12 she shifted to studying Accounting instead but later realised that her heart was really in IT.
    </p>
    
    <p> <b> Junshou Su s3799717 </b> </p>
    <p>
Junshou, more known by his English name of Jack is a Chinese national, came to Australia to pursue higher education. Jack is fluent in three languages, English, Cantonese, and Mandarin. His hobbies include playing his favourite sports – Soccer and Table tennis, as well as watching movies and listening to music. Jack developed his interest in IT when he was in high school where computers appealed to him like a magical occurrence. He was also very fond of Steve Jobs and enjoys calculation and data analysis. Therefore, he wishes to pursue a career as Database Administrator one day.
    </p>
    
    <p> <b> Hang Xing s3799719 </b> </p>
    <p>
Bank, as he preferred to be called, also originated from China. Bank came to Australia to study for 2 years as part of a requirement on his study program in China. During his downtime, Bank likes to spend it playing basketball. Bank discovered his interest in IT when the iPhone 4 was launched. Like Jack, he was also inspired by Steve Jobs that is why he enrols to this IT course to expand his knowledge in IT.
    </p>

<p> <h5> <center> Group Chemistry </h5> </center> </p>
<p>
PCS’s group personalities are majorly composed of Extroverts, Intuitive, Feeling, and Judger. <br>
Catherine has a personality of an Extrovert, Sensor, Thinker, and a Judger. She is natural when it comes to organizing, level-headed, articulate, and direct. While, Shashika and Jack almost have the same personality – Intuitive, Feeling, Judger, the only difference is Jack is an Introvert while Shashika is an Extrovert. Unlike Catherine, Jack and Shashika both lean on trusting their feelings rather than their mind but also follow their intuition rather than what their senses tell them.
</p>

<p>
The learning style of the group is the majority of Tactile and Visuals. Bank is however unique as he is both equally Tactile and Visual and is also slightly Auditory learner. The team mostly learns through touching and doing, they prefer "hands-on" learning where they can touch, move, build, or draw what they learned, and tends to learn better when some type of physical activity is involved.
This means, as a team PCS must make learning fun and exciting. While working on projects, meetings and daily communication is important as they all learn from each other through visually explaining ideas. They will also require breaks often as they are active and tend to lose focus when stuck in one position at times.
</p>

<p> 
According to the test, the working style of the group is greatly compatible. Catherine is a person who likes everything planned out, relationship-oriented, and realistic. She also does not admire people who waste her time. Shashika on the other hand, is also a strong-willed person, likes a good plan and communicates her ideas well and knows how to keep people engaged. They both inquire and collect information before they act. Jack is also a man of having core life goals which he works hard for. Jack likes to use his talents in a way that allows him to achieve success and feel positively about his contribution to the world. He is also great at developing unique ideas, the creative mind in the mostly detail-oriented group.
</p>
 
 
 <p> <h5> <center> Ideal Jobs </h5> </center> </p>
 <p>
 <ul>
 <li> Catherine: <b>Human Resources Consultant </b> </li>
<li> Shashika: <b>Cyber Security </b> </li>
<li> Jack: <b>Database Administrator </b> </li>
<li> Bank: <b>Cloud Engineer </b> </li>
</ul>
</p>

<p> 
The common aspect in the group’s ideal job is that they all touch on with IT. All the jobs involve analysing data, though for different purposes. Catherine analyzes human resourcing and workplace data while the other three involve internet and cyber data. Across the group, the minimum qualification for the job is the same except for the HR Consultant which requires some business and management knowledge.
