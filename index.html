    <p> <b> Lenjie Cunanan s3660421 </b> </p>
    <p>
Lenjie, more known by her second name “Catherine” is born and bred in Philippines. She moved to Australia in 2015 to be reunited with her parents. Her hobbies include, cooking, hiking, and playing board games. When she was in Year 7-10, she learned the basics of HTML, she has also been a contender for some IT quiz bowls in her school. But despite all the exposure to IT, she was never really interested in it, as she only sees it as another subject to pass and another extracurricular activity to boost up her grades. Her interest in IT sparked when she met her stepfather, who is a Security Data Architect. She further realised how massive the influence of IT is in all areas of jobs. Hence, why she pursued to learn more about it.  
  </p>
    
    <p> <b> Patikiri Arachchige Dona Wijayasekara s3856842 </b> <p>
    <p>
Patikiri or more known as “Shashika”, originated from Sri Lanka, bearing her, her Sri Lankan and Sinhalese culture, also fluent in English, Sinhala, Tamil, and Hindi. Shashika has been in Australia for 7 years now. She has a hobby of following up with fashion styling which she wishes to build a blog, someday. Her interest in IT started at an early age of 10, when she had her first lesson of IT. She further seeks more learning into it in her Year 10 where she took up Diploma in IT. However, in Year 12 she shifted to studying Accounting instead but later realised that her heart was really in IT.
    </p>
    
    <p> <b> Junshou Su s3799717 </b> </p>
    <p>
Junshou, more known by his English name of Jack is a Chinese national, came to Australia to pursue higher education. Jack is fluent in three languages, English, Cantonese, and Mandarin. His hobbies include playing his favourite sports – Soccer and Table tennis, as well as watching movies and listening to music. Jack developed his interest in IT when he was in high school where computers appealed to him like a magical occurrence. He was also very fond of Steve Jobs and enjoys calculation and data analysis. Therefore, he wishes to pursue a career as Database Administrator one day.
    </p>
    
    <p> <b> Hang Xing s3799719 </b> </p>
    <p>
Bank, as he preferred to be called, also originated from China. Bank came to Australia to study for 2 years as part of a requirement on his study program in China. During his downtime, Bank likes to spend it playing basketball. Bank discovered his interest in IT when the iPhone 4 was launched. Like Jack, he was also inspired by Steve Jobs that is why he enrols to this IT course to expand his knowledge in IT.
    </p>

<p> <h5> <center> Group Chemistry </h5> </center> </p>
<p>
PCS’s group personalities are majorly composed of Extroverts, Intuitive, Feeling, and Judger. <br>
Catherine has a personality of an Extrovert, Sensor, Thinker, and a Judger. She is natural when it comes to organizing, level-headed, articulate, and direct. While, Shashika and Jack almost have the same personality – Intuitive, Feeling, Judger, the only difference is Jack is an Introvert while Shashika is an Extrovert. Unlike Catherine, Jack and Shashika both lean on trusting their feelings rather than their mind but also follow their intuition rather than what their senses tell them.
</p>

<p>
The learning style of the group is the majority of Tactile and Visuals. Bank is however unique as he is both equally Tactile and Visual and is also slightly Auditory learner. The team mostly learns through touching and doing, they prefer "hands-on" learning where they can touch, move, build, or draw what they learned, and tends to learn better when some type of physical activity is involved.
This means, as a team PCS must make learning fun and exciting. While working on projects, meetings and daily communication is important as they all learn from each other through visually explaining ideas. They will also require breaks often as they are active and tend to lose focus when stuck in one position at times.
</p>

<p> 
According to the test, the working style of the group is greatly compatible. Catherine is a person who likes everything planned out, relationship-oriented, and realistic. She also does not admire people who waste her time. Shashika on the other hand, is also a strong-willed person, likes a good plan and communicates her ideas well and knows how to keep people engaged. They both inquire and collect information before they act. Jack is also a man of having core life goals which he works hard for. Jack likes to use his talents in a way that allows him to achieve success and feel positively about his contribution to the world. He is also great at developing unique ideas, the creative mind in the mostly detail-oriented group.
</p>
 
 
 <p> <h5> <center> Ideal Jobs </h5> </center> </p>
 <p>
 <ul>
 <li> Catherine: <b>Human Resources Consultant </b> </li>
<li> Shashika: <b>Cyber Security </b> </li>
<li> Jack: <b>Database Administrator </b> </li>
<li> Bank: <b>Cloud Engineer </b> </li>
</ul>
</p>

<p> 
The common aspect in the group’s ideal job is that they all touch on with IT. All the jobs involve analysing data, though for different purposes. Catherine analyzes human resourcing and workplace data while the other three involve internet and cyber data. Across the group, the minimum qualification for the job is the same except for the HR Consultant which requires some business and management knowledge.

  <h3 class="w3-center">IT TECHNOLOGIES</h3>
<h4 class="w3-center">Internet of Things(IoT)</h4>
<p>
The Internet of Things is a system where the computer and digital devices interconnects through sensors and transmit data without human contact. This is an internetworking system where our daily life connects to exchange data through internet. This technology controls electrical equipment remotely and helps most of the industries in the world such as manufacturing, transportation etc.	</p>
<p>
Most people use IoT through their wearables such as fit bits and smartwatches where this technology is used as a wearable technology. IoT helps to communicate through devices where describes as machine to machine communication. IoT applications are another way to use this technology for the smart appliances at home where people can use to control their electrical equipment. Also, health care uses IoT applications to examine and analyse data for medical researches. Smart Cities are another concept which came through IoT. It helps people for their daily activities such as traffic controlling to ease the problems without happening accidents. IoT gave agriculture field a new concept named Smart Greenhouse where farmers can yield crops with less costs. Industrial Automation is another field where IoT applications come to work with logistics, inventory, factory digitalization, quality control and packaging.  
</p>
<p>
In three years, IoT will help Automobile industry as they invested over $100 billion on self-driving cars development in last five years. Autonomous vehicles will be developed through IoT to transmit data through mechanical sensors and GPS with the technology to give the ultimate comfort to the driver. Cellular technologies such as NB IoT and Cat-M1 will be expanded through 5G network expansion according the reports from the Ericsson as the network expands the benefits will be on the reduction hardware prices and cellular technologies. As businesses are identifying the opportunities through IoT, the companies are investing more on this technology to gain profits in future. Industries such as clothing, healthcare, agriculture and municipalities are investing on IoT to have IT solutions through IoT networks. So, in future there will be more developed solutions for those industries other than in IT industry to help customers through their daily life. According to a research by McKinsey Global Institute, there will be a rapid growth in IoT as most companies are using this technology in modern ways such as tracking the supply chains using sensors. Home IoT market will grow making daily life easier with smart electrical appliances, entertainment devices, security systems etc. Moreover, manufacturing companies will start to use more IoT devices for their process to get best result from efficient energy and high level production with IoT machines which are capable of automated tasks.
</p>
<p>
IoT is consisted of hardware devices, software, communication and platforms. Hardware is the smart devices which IoT technology uses to gather data and communicate through. Software is the main component which works as the major part in the hardware devices which helps to gather data and transmit through IoT technology. Smart devices are connected through the communication to transmit collected data through connectivity solutions such as cellular, LAN, satellite or IoT environments such as ZigBee, Thread, Z-Wave, MQTT, LwM2M. These solutions do not work as only an option to send and receive data through cloud, where it works as a third party to communicate with other devices as well. IoT platforms are where that data collected, processed, analysed and transmitted through a user-friendly interference. Short range solutions like Bluetooth, RFID supports IoT technology to transmit data through devices such as wearables and helps to locate object positions in industries such as logistics through radio frequency identification. RFID has been developing to locate patients in healthcare industry to minimise the issue of out of stock situation in stores. Implementing these technologies can reduce costs and will help to get best from IoT technology for users.
</p>
<h5 class="w3-left">Effects of IoT</h5>
<p>
IoT technology impacts whole world from daily life of a person to industries such as logistics. Calculating the heart rate through a smart watch and transmitting the data and notifying the users about changes of any health conditions will help users to be alert and it’s not simple as that when IoT technology locates a user through their own wearables for their own safety in an difficult situation. Things will change from high power to low power where expensive solutions will be replaced by cheaper solutions for the users with giving more benefits to the users such as Sigfox connectivity solution. Sigfox helps various kinds of M2M applications to implement smart street lighting system, smart security systems, smart monitors and sensors. Automobile, Healthcare, Manufacturing, Agriculture, Retail, Hospitality, Finance and Transportation will be most affected industries through implemented IoT technology. From Self cars in Automobile industry to smart sensors in manufacturing processes IoT helps through every step to succeed in industries. People in these industries can use this technology to ease the tasks and unfortunately some jobs will be replaced through this technology in most industries. However, more jobs will be come to place because of the maintenance of these devices and technologies whenever they need. Jobs related to IT sector will be expanded as more technologies get implemented.
</p>
<h5 class="w3-left">Effects of IoT as Users</h5>
<p>
As a user, my costs will be low with IoT technology because it minimises the energy costs where we spend so much, and it makes our lives easy through smart homes and smart cities as well. Traffic will be eased, and more time will be saved on the roads and more tasks will be done by the IoT technology where we used to do everything manually. If something is wrong at my home when I am outside, I’ll get notifications to know without ending up to big mess through our daily lives. These implemented devices guarantee us more safety when we care more about our family and friends such as tracking their locations when they are alone or talking to each other even via smart watches. Developing waste management solutions through IoT will be more helpful when it comes to effect soon as it is a great way to improve the environment which affects all of us.  Personal health will be the most important thing where we can check irregular patterns in our heart rates, sleeping patterns of us and our loved ones too.

  <h3 class="w3-center">PROJECT IDEAS</h3>
 <center> <img src="fashion.jpg" alt="fashion" width="450" height="300"> </center>
  <p>
    Fashion and dressing up is never easy for everyone. Some have good eyes on fashion and immediately know what to wear while others just grab the first thing they can get from their wardrobe, and the other bunch spends so much time thinking on what to wear. According to The Telegraph, a recent study found that the average woman, in the course of her lifetime, spends almost one year standing in front of her closet deciding what to wear. The study, which polled 2,491 women and was based on an adult lifetime from age 16 to 60, found that women spend an average of 16 minutes deciding what to wear on weekday mornings and 14 minutes on Saturdays and Sundays, for a whopping 287 days spread out over their lives.
</p>

<p>
<ul>
<li> Hitting the town on Friday night – 20 minutes </li>
<li> Christmas party or fancy dinner event – 36 minutes </li>
<li> Heading out of town for a vacation – 52 minutes </li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>
And on regular weekday mornings, most women try on at least two outfits before deciding what to wear to work.
</p>
<p>
This is why our group introduces *Noting to Wear*. <br>
Noting to Wear as you guessed it is adapted from the common phrase we say when we have “nothing to wear”, which really just means having an exact outfit in my mind but does not own the exact pieces to put that outfit together. Noting to Wear is a fashion styling app that composes and suggests the users what to wear depending on the weather, their area of location while also considering their own collection of clothes.
</p>

<center> <img src="avatar_qr.PNG" alt="avatarqr" width="550" height="300"> </center>

<p>
  NtW allows the user to create their own avatar, add their clothes collection through the QR code that is attached on the clothes when first bought or scan the clothes itself to allow the app to collect the form and color of the users’ dress or shirt. The application also encourages the user to allow the app to collect their location, in order for the app to figure the weather of that area and its fashion trends. The user is allowed to choose and input the occasion or the purpose of their dressing up.
  </p>

<p>
For example, the user has a date with her partner on Thursday night. She inputs the location of where she and her partner will have their date, it then allows the app to collect the weather of the area. Since she is a new user, she scanned her clothes to build her clothes collection in the app, she also scanned the QR codes of the dresses she just bought. So now, the app has all the information it requires to suggest the user what to wear.
</p>
<ul>
<li> Occasion: <i> Date night </i> </li>
<li> Location: <i> Melbourne CBD </i> </li>
<li> Weather: <i> 32C Warm </i> </li>
<li> When: <i> Thursday 25th </i> </li>
</ul>
The app will then suggest something like this.
<center> <img src="Inkeddressup_LI.jpg" alt="dressup" width="450" height="300"> </center>
</p>
<p>
  The user’s avatar is now wearing an outfit appropriate to the suggested inputs.

    <ol>First of all, Me as a member who joined the PCS team late after the team was established. Therefore, I think I can perform better in this team and this assignment. For example, I may be able to discuss more with my teammates and exchange our ideas. However, thanks for other three team members in the PCS, the assignment went well at the first stage when we all agreed on the topic. One thing I am surprised about is  the team works together and solve problems together no matter how small the question is. In addition, to keep contacting and discussing with teammates is what I learned from this team. It is significant to exchange ideas and help each other when troubles come. Lastly, Since we do our section individually and my section is Industry Data, I think the Github log of activity can reflect when and who is doing their job, which is important as a group.
